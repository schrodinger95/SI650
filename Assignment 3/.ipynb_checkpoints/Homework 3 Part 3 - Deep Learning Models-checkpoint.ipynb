    "Homework 3 Part 3 will have you working with deep learning models in a variety of ways.

You should have completed Parts 1 and 2 before attempting this notebook to familiarize yourself with how PyTerrier works.\n",

    "In Part 3, you'll try the following tasks:\n",
    " - Use a large language model to re-rank content\n",
    " - Use a text-to-text model to perform query augmentation\n",
    " - Train a deep learning IR model and compare its performance.\n",

    "The first two of these tasks will rely on models that we've pretrained for you. However, we've also provided code for how to train these. In the third task, you'll do one simple training and evaluate its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first two tasks, we've provided most of the code. *You are expected to submit results showing that you have successfully executed it*. You'll need to understand some of the code to complete task 3, which requires you to write new code.\n",

    "As with the past notebooks, you'll need to have `JAVA_HOME` set, which will need to be run on Great Lakes. You can potentially set it in the notebook with a Jupyter command like\n",

Note that our doc2query model was trained on MS MARCO, which isn't the same kind of collection as CORD19, so this performance tells us how well that model can transfer to a new setting."
